    Intentional Innovation Foundation believes that developing the leaders of the future technology workforce requires a culture shift that makes engineering “cool” again. We find that the most powerful way to engage K-12 students in STEM is to provide an environment that allows them to experience science and math as a thrilling, challenging competition.
